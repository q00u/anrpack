# Stuff for R

## These are the extensions I use for developing R stuff.

Based on Kun Ren's recommendation's [here](https://renkun.me/2019/12/11/writing-r-in-vscode-a-fresh-start/)

Set `r.rterm.windows` to the path of your `R.exe`

R LSP Client requires the `R Language Server` (repository [here](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver))

```R
install.packages("languageserver")
```

Also recommended is `radian` (repository [here](https://github.com/randy3k/radian))

```bash
# install released version
pip install -U radian
```

Turn on the `r.bracketedPaste` setting in VSCode

If you've found this online, something has gone horribly wrong. I made this for my personal use.

**Enjoy!**
